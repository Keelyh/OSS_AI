Maze-Solving Robot
==================
KeelyH and sstrohkorb constructed an Arduino controlled robot that would know the map of a maze and navigate to a goal location. The robot was randomly placed in the maze, detected its location using a particle filter, and navigated to the goal using a path planning algorithm.
